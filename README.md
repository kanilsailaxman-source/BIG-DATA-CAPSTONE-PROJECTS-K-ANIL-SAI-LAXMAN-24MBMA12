Banking & Financial Analytics Projects Pack (10K Edition)
Big Data | Machine Learning | PySpark | FinTech Innovation 2025

This repository presents five end-to-end analytics projects that apply machine learning, NLP, and simulation techniques to real-world financial use cases.
Each project operates on a synthetic dataset of 10,000 rows, simulating real banking conditions.

Developed using Python, PySpark, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib, these projects illustrate how data science can drive innovation, transparency, and resilience in financial systems.
Tech Stack

Languages: Python 3.12, SQL (via PySpark)

Frameworks: PySpark, Scikit-learn, NLTK, XGBoost

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, PowerPoint (python-pptx)

Environment: Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

Data Size: 10,000 synthetic records per project
Project Insights & Recent Developments
 1. Real-Time Transaction Anomaly Detection (Fraud)

Focus: Detects unusual financial transactions based on behavior and timing.
Tech: Logistic Regression + PySpark ETL + ROC Visualization

2025 Relevance:

Global fraud losses in digital payments surpassed $400 billion, with major banks adopting AI-driven prevention systems.

Inspired by Visa’s Advanced Fraud Detection and RBI’s AI monitoring initiatives, this project shows how open-source tools can detect high-risk transaction anomalies.

2. Operational Sentiment Analysis (NLP)

Focus: Analyses customer reviews to gauge service quality trends.
Tech: TF-IDF Vectorization + Logistic Regression

2025 Relevance:

In 2025, JP Morgan and HDFC Bank introduced AI-driven Voice of Customer Analytics for continuous feedback monitoring.

This project replicates such real-time sentiment tracking using open data and NLP.

3. ESG Data Aggregation & Portfolio Scoring

Focus: Quantifies sustainability in investment portfolios.
Tech: Weighted ESG aggregation model

 2025 Relevance:

Following SEBI’s new ESG BRSR Core framework (2024–25) and EU Green Taxonomy updates, financial institutions are integrating data-driven ESG reporting.

This project mirrors institutional ESG scoring workflows for ethical investing and disclosure compliance.

4. Credit Risk Stress Testing Simulation

Focus: Models portfolio risk under macroeconomic stress scenarios.
Tech: Monte Carlo Simulation + Distribution Analysis

 2025 Relevance:

In response to post-COVID credit shocks and rising NPAs in emerging markets, RBI and IMF recommended regular stress testing.

This project simulates “recession scenarios” akin to Basel III stress protocols.

 5. CBDC Transaction Velocity Monitoring

Focus: Tracks and analyzes the velocity of Central Bank Digital Currency transactions.
Tech: Z-score Anomaly Detection + Time-Series Visualization

 2025 Relevance:

With India’s e₹ (Digital Rupee) expanding to merchant and retail sectors, transaction analytics have become crucial.

This project models how central banks can monitor anomalous activity and ensure liquidity stability in CBDC systems.

 Real-World Applications

Banking Risk Teams: Fraud scoring and stress testing.

Customer Experience Units: Sentiment dashboards and service improvement.

Asset Management Firms: ESG portfolio transparency.




Regulatory Bodies: CBDC monitoring and compliance analytics.
